# pre-check
  The validation of the CI is done on pre-check. The workflow used for the execution of pre-check is [mci-pre-check.yaml](https://github.com/glcp/managed-ci-workflow/blob/main/.github/workflows/mci-pre-check.yaml). For GO based application the **secret-scanner, mci-golang** jobs are triggered.

The jobs that are executed for python based application on pre-check

| _Jobs_             | _Description_                                                                  |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **secret-scanner** | Secret Scanner is executed without any conditions on all repositories. As the name suggests the jobs scans for the unencrypted/plain-text secrets/passwords in the latest commit and reports it to the code-owner. |
| **mci-golang**     | python job is intended for application based on **golang**. The job is executed based on the conditions provided in **Repository Variables** [**if: vars.GLCP_BUILD_SYSTEM == 'golang'**].|

## 1. secret-scanner:
Secret Scanner is executed without any conditions on all repositories. As the name suggests the jobs scans for the unencrypted/plain-text secrets/passwords in the latest commit and reports it to the code-owner.
The workflow used for the execution of secret-scanner is [scanning-workflow.yml](https://github.com/glcp/Secret-Scan-Tool/blob/main/.github/workflows/scanning-workflow.yml)

### Deafult Inputs for secret-scan

| _Input_             | _Default_                               | _Description_                                                       | _Required_  |
|:-------------------:|:----------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------|
| repo                | ```${{github.event.repository.name}}``` | Name of the repository where secret scan need to be executed        | true        |
| branch              | ```${{github.ref_name}}```              | Branch in which secret-scan need to be executed on the given repo   | true        |

## 2. mci-golang:
The job is executed based on the conditions provided in **Repository Variables** [**if: vars.GLCP_BUILD_SYSTEM == 'golang'**]. 

**when the conditions are satisfied the job does the following actions.**
