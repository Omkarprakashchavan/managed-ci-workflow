# pre-stage
The pre-stage job depends on the pre-check job. The pre-stage workflow need/will be in the application repository **.github/workflows** folder. This is just a boilerplate workflow, which the application team can use to execute project specific jobs before Lint that cann't be incorporated in MANAGED CI. The reference workflow for pre-stage is [mci-pre-stage.yaml](https://github.com/glcp/managed-ci-workflow/tree/v1.4.0/templates/mci-pre-stage.yaml)
